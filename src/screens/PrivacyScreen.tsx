          This Privacy Policy explains how <B>Groovy Technoweb Private Limited</B> (“gVoice”, “we”, “us” or
          “our”) collects, uses, shares and protects personal data when you use the gVoice
          meeting-intelligence platform, websites and related services (the “Service”). gVoice is a product
          of Groovy Technoweb Private Limited, registered at 517–520, CenterSquare, Santram Road, Nadiad –
          387001, Gujarat, India. By using the Service you agree to this Policy.

        <P>
          Where gVoice processes meeting content on behalf of a business customer that has its own
          relationship with the meeting participants, gVoice may act as a <B>data processor</B> for that
          content and the customer is the controller. In that case the customer’s own privacy notice governs,
          and we process the content under our agreement with them.

      </Section>

      <Section n="2" title="Information we collect">
        <P>We collect the following categories of personal data:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>
            <B>Account data</B> — your name, email address and a securely hashed password (we never store
            passwords in plain text). If you sign in with a third-party identity provider, we receive your
            basic profile and email from that provider.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>Calendar &amp; connection data</B> — when you connect Google or Microsoft, we store
            access/refresh tokens (encrypted) and the calendar event details needed to schedule and auto-join
            meetings (titles, times, join links, organiser and invitee information).
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>Meeting content</B> — when you (or your settings) send the gVoice bot to a meeting, we capture
            and store the meeting <B>audio recording</B>, <B>captions</B>, a <B>diarized transcript</B>
            {" "}(who-said-what), the <B>list of participants</B> and their join/leave activity, and the{" "}
            <B>AI-generated outputs</B> we create from it (summaries, chapters, action items, decisions and
            sentiment — the “meeting report”).
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>Usage &amp; technical data</B> — log data such as IP address, device/browser type, pages
            viewed, feature usage, timestamps and diagnostic information, used to operate and secure the
            Service.
          </LI>
          <LI>
            <B>Cookies &amp; similar technologies</B> — see the Cookies section below.
          </LI>
        </UL>
        <P>
          Meeting audio and transcripts may include the voices and statements of people who are not gVoice
          account holders. Voice and speech can constitute sensitive personal data in some jurisdictions. We
          rely on the account holder who invites the bot to ensure a lawful basis and any required consent
          exists (see <B>Meeting recording &amp; consent</B>).
        </P>
      </Section>

      <Section n="3" title="How we use your data and our legal bases">
        <P>We use personal data to:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>provide the Service — join meetings, record, transcribe, diarize and generate reports;</LI>
          <LI>authenticate you, maintain your account and provide support;</LI>

          <LI>comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>
          Under the GDPR our legal bases are: <B>performance of a contract</B> (providing the Service you
          requested), <B>legitimate interests</B> (securing and improving the Service), <B>consent</B> (where
          required, e.g. certain cookies or recording where we obtain it directly), and <B>legal obligation</B>.
          Under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, we process personal data on the basis of
          your <B>consent</B> or other <B>legitimate uses</B> permitted by the Act. You may withdraw consent at
          any time (see <B>Your rights</B>).

      </Section>

      <Section n="4" title="Meeting recording & consent">
        <Callout>
          <B>Recording laws vary by country and region.</B> Some jurisdictions require the consent of every
          participant before a meeting may be recorded. You are responsible for understanding and complying
          with the laws that apply to your meetings.
        </Callout>
        <P>
          The gVoice bot joins meetings as a <B>clearly named, visible participant</B> so attendees can see
          that the meeting is being recorded. However, the gVoice account holder who sends the bot is
          responsible for obtaining all consents and providing all notices required by law before the
          recording begins. By using the recording features you confirm that you have the authority and all
          necessary consents to record and process the meeting and the participants’ contributions.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you are a meeting participant and do not consent to being recorded, please tell the meeting host,
          who can remove the bot or stop the recording. To exercise your rights over a recording, contact us
          using the details below; we will route your request to the relevant account holder where we act as a
          processor.

          To deliver the Service we share the minimum necessary data with trusted infrastructure and AI
          providers that process it on our instructions and under contractual confidentiality and security
          obligations. We do <B>not</B> sell your personal data, and we do not permit our providers to use your
          meeting content to train their own general-purpose models except as required to provide the feature
          you requested.

          <LI>with the sub-processors listed above, to operate the Service;</LI>

      <Section n="7" title="International data transfers">
        <P>
          gVoice operates from India and uses providers located in India, the European Union and the United
          States. Where personal data is transferred across borders — including out of the EEA/UK — we rely on
          appropriate safeguards such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses and equivalent
          measures, together with technical protections like encryption.
        </P>

      <Section n="8" title="Data retention">
        <P>We keep personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Policy:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>
            <B>Meeting content</B> (recordings, transcripts and reports) is retained until you delete it or
            close your account. When you delete a meeting or your account, we remove the content from active
            systems within <B>30 days</B> and from encrypted backups within <B>90 days</B>.
          </LI>
          <LI>

          <LI>
            <B>Logs and diagnostic data</B> are retained for a limited period for security and troubleshooting.

      </Section>

      <Section n="9" title="How we protect your data">
        <P>
          We use technical and organisational measures appropriate to the risk, including encryption of data in
          transit (TLS) and at rest, encryption of stored third-party tokens, password hashing (bcrypt), access
          controls and least-privilege administration, network isolation and logging. No method of transmission
          or storage is completely secure, but we work to protect your data and to notify you and the
          authorities of any breach as required by law.

      </Section>

      <Section n="10" title="Your rights">
        <P>
          Depending on where you live, you may have the right to: access your personal data; correct inaccurate
          data; delete data (“right to erasure”); restrict or object to certain processing; data portability;
          withdraw consent; and the right to nominate (under India’s DPDP Act) or to lodge a complaint with a
          supervisory authority. California residents have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including the right to
          know, delete and correct, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising those rights —
          and, because we do not sell or share personal data for advertising, there is nothing to opt out of in
          that respect.
        </P>
        <P>
          To exercise any right, email <Mail address="hello@groovyweb.co" />. We will verify your request and
          respond within the timeframes required by applicable law. You may also manage and delete much of your
          data directly from within your gVoice dashboard.
